Project 2

This project is a small RPG battle system that I made to practice classes and inheritance. It includes different character types, weapons, and a basic simulator. The main goal is to show my understanding of parent classes and child classes and how the work, along with how override methods work.

What The project does

Character System(Classes)
Character
Player
Warrior
Mage
Rouge
Weapon
Each class has its own stats like health, strength, and magic. They also have different attack ablilites.

Special Abilities
Warriors use power strikes
Mages cast fireballs
Rouges do sneak attacks
These moves do extra damage.

Weapon System
Each weapon has a name and a damage bouns.

Battle Simulator
Has a battle between 2 characters going through characters starting stats, then their round 1 attacks, finally their final results of the battle.

How to use

When you run the project it will create a warrior, mage, and rouge. It will then show the stats of each, next it test their attacks. Then it will show their special abilites then their weapons. Finally running a battle between 2 characters.
